# MetaMask

MetaMask is a popular decentralized wallet and browser extension primarily used for managing and trading Ethereum and its compatible tokens. It allows users to interact directly with decentralized applications (DApps) in a web browser without the need to download the entire blockchain node. Here are some of the main features and characteristics of MetaMask:

## Main Features:

* **Digital Asset Management**: Users can securely store, send, and receive Ethereum (ETH) and compatible tokens such as ERC-20 and ERC-721.

* **DApp Interaction**: As a browser extension, MetaMask allows users to interact directly with decentralized applications on the web, such as decentralized exchanges, games, and NFT marketplaces.

* **Private Key Management**: Users' private keys are stored locally, and MetaMask does not save any personal information, ensuring that users have complete control over their assets.

* **Multi-Network Support**: In addition to the Ethereum mainnet, MetaMask supports other Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks (such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.), allowing users to easily switch between different networks.

* **Custom RPC**: Users can add custom RPC URLs to connect to other blockchains or private networks.
